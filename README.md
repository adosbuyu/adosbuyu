# 👋 Hi, I'm Heather Osunga Buyu

Welcome to my data portfolio! I'm a former high school math teacher turned data analyst, passionate about transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.

🎓 I completed the **Data Analyst program at Coding Temple**, where I developed strong foundations in Python, SQL, Tableau, machine learning, and data storytelling. During the program, I completed a series of structured projects, including the **R Project**, **Capstone One**, and **Capstone Two**.

💼 Most recently, I completed a **Tech Residency with Coding Temple via Riipen**, where I worked on **WholeViz** (formerly NovaViz/NewsViz) — a full-stack, no-code data visualization platform that allowed me to apply advanced skills in access control, logging, simulation, and visualization logic in a production-style environment.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🧠 WholeViz (Tech Residency Project)  
**Role:** Data Analyst (Internship via Riipen & Coding Temple)  
**Live Demo:** *(Coming soon)*[https://www.wholeviz.com/](https://www.wholeviz.com/)  
**Repo:** *(Coming soon)*  
**Tools:** Python · PostgreSQL · SQL · Plotly · Jupyter · Google Colab · Chart.js · RBAC · Auth0

WholeViz is a no-code data visualization platform built for users with no technical background. It features drag-and-drop charts, user role management, real-time logging, smart chart selection, and export controls based on subscription tier.

**My Core Contributions:**
- 🧠 **Smart Chart & Tooltip Logic**: Helped develop an adaptive system that auto-selects the best chart type based on uploaded dataset structure. Added dynamic tooltips that varied based on user roles and permissions.
- 🔐 **RBAC & Permission Simulation**: Modeled user access across account, workspace, and object levels using matrix-based enforcement logic. Verified visualization access, export limits, and feature visibility per role and plan.
- 📤 **Export Feature Enforcement**: Built logic that restricted export access (PDF, PNG, SVG) based on plan tier. Simulated fallback behaviors for free users and confirmed output aligned with UI design.
- 🧾 **Access Logging & Activity Monitoring**: Simulated full admin-side logging of user actions (create, export, embed) including IP/device info and role-based metadata. Outputs were used for system auditing.
- 🔄 **Feature Prototyping & Testing**: Worked on workflows for future features like editable datasets, comment threads, and public/private toggles. Ensured frontend alignment with backend schemas.
- 📝 **Documentation & Reporting**: Co-wrote technical documentation describing lifecycle of data from upload → cleaning → visualization → export. Authored access-control diagrams and test-run performance reports.

This project allowed me to operate in a full-team environment, collaborating with frontend and backend developers and applying my skills to a complex, modular system that mimicked real-world SaaS workflows.

### 🚀 Spaceship Titanic Passenger Prediction  
**Role:** Data Analyst (Bootcamp Project)  
**GitHub Repo:** [adosbuyu/R_Project](https://github.com/adosbuyu/R_Project)  
**Tools:** Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · XGBoost · Matplotlib · Seaborn

Used machine learning models to predict whether passengers aboard the fictional Spaceship Titanic were transported to another dimension based on spending and demographic data.

**Highlights:**
- Feature engineering + missing value imputation
- Built models with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Achieved **83% accuracy** with XGBoost

### 📊 Capstone One: Cereal Ratings Analysis  
**Role:** Data Analyst (Bootcamp Project)  
**GitHub Repo:** [adosbuyu/CapstoneOne](https://github.com/adosbuyu/CapstoneOne)  
**Tools:** Python · R · Pandas · ggplot2 · Seaborn · Matplotlib

Explored relationships between cereal nutrition (sugar, fiber, protein) and ratings. Validated hypotheses on children’s cereals vs. healthy cereals using Python and R.

**Highlights:**
- Confirmed high-sugar cereals receive lower ratings
- Found strong correlation between protein and rating
- Used heatmaps, scatterplots, boxplots for storytelling
